In order to see the query that's being executed I should put breakpoint on: 

InsisViewObjectImpl.executeQueryForCollection / 
InsisViewObjectImpl.executeQuery 
in Watches to add: getQuery(), getNamedWhereClauseParams(), getViewObject()

In order to check which event is being called: 
DefaultProcessor.fireEvent(SysEvent e, Map context) 
the name of the event is the input parameter
